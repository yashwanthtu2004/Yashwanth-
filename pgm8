\section{Introduction}
Theorems can easily be defined:
\begin{theorem}
Let \(f\) be a function whose derivative exists in every point,then \(f\) is a continuous function.\\
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
\label{Pythagorean}
This is a theorem about right triangles and can be summarised in the next equation
\[x^2 + y^2 = z^2\]
\end{theorem}
And a consequence of theorem \ref{Pythagorean} is a statement in the next corollary. \begin{corollary}
There's no right rectangle whose sides measure 3cm, 4cm, and 6cm. \end{corollary}
You can reference theorem such as theorem\ref{Pythagorean} when a label is assigned. \begin{lemma}
Given two line segments whose lengths are \(a\) and \(b\)
respectively there is a real number \(r\) such that \(b = ra\). \end{lemma}
